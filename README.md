# RLCS SCRAPPER

A little project to send notification a certain time before the next match.
Later I'll add the option to choose a match from which you want to receive notification.
You'll be able to choose the delay between the notification and the matches.

Atm, the script can grab all upcoming events and all upcoming matches.
