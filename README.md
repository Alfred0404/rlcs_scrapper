# RLCS SCRAPPER
## Description

This little project is a web app that shows some informations about Rocket League esport matches or tournaments.
Currently, the python script can browse matches or events from the API with different filters, which are not implemented in the web app yet.


## Libraries
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- [datatime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)

## API

I'm using the [octane.gg](https://zsr.octane.gg/)'s API. It's an API that let you browse loads of interesting infos about everything that can happen in Rocket League esport (matches, events, teams, players, records, and a bunch of other stats).
