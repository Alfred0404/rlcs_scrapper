# RLCS SCRAPPER
## Description

A little project to send notification before the next match.
Later I'll add the option to choose a match from which you want to receive notification.
You'll get notified in the morning if there is a match during the day.

Atm, the script can grab all upcoming events, all upcoming matches filtered or not by team.
