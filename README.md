# RLCS SCRAPPER
## Description
This little project is a web app that shows some informations about Rocket League esport matches or tournaments.
Currently, the app can browse matches or events from the API with different filters

## Installation
1. Install the libraries :
   - [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)    `pip install requests`
   - [datatime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)   `pip install datetime`
   - [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)    `pip install flask`

## Usage
Currently, you chan choose to run only the `main.py` file, or the entire flask app, by running `python -m flask run` in your terminal.
Once on the web app, you can go to the matchs or events page, to start looking for events or matchs.

## API
I'm using the [octane.gg](https://zsr.octane.gg/)'s API. It's an API that let you browse loads of interesting infos about everything that can happen in Rocket League esport (matches, events, teams, players, records, and a bunch of other stats).
