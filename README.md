## Installation

1. Install the libraries :
   - [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)    `pip install requests`
   - [datatime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)   `pip install datetime`

## Usage

Currently, you chan choose to run only the `main.py` file, or the entire flask app, by running `python -m flask run` in your terminal, then click the localhost link.
Once on the web app, you can navigate to the matches page or the events page, to start gather informations about everything you want.

On the matches page, you can filter matches by :

- Region
- Team
- Event
- Date

For every match on this page, you can choose to be notified to it, just by clicking the "Get notified" button.

Same for the events page, you can filter events by :

- Region
- Event Name

For every event on the page, you can click the "See matches" button. It will redirect you on the "matches" page, where you will find all the matches of this event.

## API

I'm using the [octane.gg](https://zsr.octane.gg/)'s API. It's an API that let you browse loads of interesting infos about everything that can happen in Rocket League esport (matches, events, teams, players, records, and a bunch of other stats).
